NOTE:

In order to run database.js you need to have a .env file in the same folder as the function. 
The contents of the .env will be as follows:

MYSQL_HOST='ip address of the database that you are using to run GoodsWebsiteDatabase.sql'
MYSQL_USER='root'
MYSQL_PASSWORD='the password for your database'
MYSQL_DATABASE= 'GoodsWebsiteDatabase'
